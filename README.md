To analyze student academic and behavioral data in order to develop a predictive model that identifies students who are likely to drop out (churn) from the institution.

Outcomes

A working predictive model that helps the institution detect at-risk students early, enabling timely academic or counseling interventions to reduce dropout rates.

Required Tools

IBM SPSS Modeler for data processing and model building, MS Excel for dataset handling.
